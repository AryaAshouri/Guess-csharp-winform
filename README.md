    Guess the number
</h1>

## 📖 Description<br>
As I mentioned in the description this is my new project which is one of those most popular games ever and it's really easy because the onliest thing you should do is to guess a number and see if it's true or not. Then if the number wouldn't be true it will tell you it's bigger of smaller and that's all about It! Of course It's not that hard to write the code and that's why I decided to improve it and make It better. so I made new levels with different chances with different ranges and also added signin page which works with my lastname and usuall name.

## 📷 Pictures<br>
Here you can see the sign-in page where you should write my lastname as the username and my name as the passord. The other pages shows different levels of this game to make it more challenging:

## 🔥 Levels<br>
These pictures refers to all levels in the game which I designed. They are three levels for the game include easy, hard, impossible which have differences. for example in the easiest one you have 5 chances to guess a number between 1 and 10 but in the hardest one you've got 10 chances to guess a number between 1 and 1000:
